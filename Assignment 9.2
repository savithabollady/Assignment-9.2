• A typical null hypothesis is a statement that two variables are not related. 
Other examples are statements that there is no difference between two groups (or treatments) or that there is no difference 
from an existing standard value.

• An alternative hypothesis is a statement that there is a relationship between two variables or there is a difference between
two groups or there is a difference from a previous or existing standard.
A statistical hypothesis test is a procedure for deciding between two possible statements about a population.
